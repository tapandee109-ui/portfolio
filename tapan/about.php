            I'm Tapan Rajyaguru, a Software Engineer based in Ahmedabad. I
            believe that digital products should not only work perfectly but
            also look breathtaking.

              Currently in my final year of Information Technology at Marwadi
              University, I've spent the last few years mastering the art of
              full-stack development. My journey is driven by a constant
              curiosity for new technologies and a passion for minimalist
              design.
